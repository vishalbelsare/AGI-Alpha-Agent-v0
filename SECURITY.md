## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please contact us at <security@montreal.ai>.

Thank you for helping keep this project safe.

## CI security workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow [`security.yml`](.github/workflows/security.yml) builds and signs the container image. It generates CycloneDX SBOM files for the Python and Node packages, scans the final image with Trivy and fails if any high or critical vulnerabilities are found. After a successful scan the image is signed with `cosign` and an SLSA provenance file is attached to the GitHub Release along with the SBOMs.
