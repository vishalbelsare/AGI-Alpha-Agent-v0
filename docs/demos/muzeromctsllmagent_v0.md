![preview](../muzeromctsllmagent_v0/assets/preview.svg){.demo-preview}
Each demo package exposes its own `__version__` constant. The value marks the revision of that demo only and does not reflect the overall Alpha‑Factory release version.


# MuZero MCTS LLM Agent Demo

This folder contains a prototype integration of a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agent with language model guidance. Run `install_and_launch.sh` to build the environment and start the demo in your browser.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.
2. Execute `./install_and_launch.sh`.
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the agent.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to explore planning outputs.

```bash
./install_and_launch.sh
```

## Notes
- Requires approximately 2GB RAM and basic Docker support.
- Provided for research purposes only; not a production trading system.
