# α‑AGI Insight 👁️✨ — Beyond Human Foresight — Official Demo (Zero Data)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/blob/main/alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v0/colab_alpha_agi_insight_demo.ipynb)


The **α‑AGI Insight** demo predicts which industry sector is most likely to be
transformed by Artificial General Intelligence. It runs a small
**Meta‑Agentic Tree Search** (MATS) over a list of sector names. No external
data is required so the script executes fully offline. Pass a custom sector
list with ``--sectors`` to experiment with your own domains. When the argument
points to a text file, each non-empty line is treated as a sector name. The
demo automatically integrates with the OpenAI Agents runtime and optionally the
Google ADK gateway whenever credentials are present.

> **Note**
> Older convenience entry points such as ``alpha-agi-insight`` were removed.
> Run ``python official_demo_final.py`` (or ``run_demo.py``) directly to launch
> the demo.

**Quick Start:** run ``python official_demo_final.py --episodes 5`` to launch
the final production demo with automatic environment selection. The script
transparently chooses between the hosted runtime and offline mode depending on
available credentials.
The demo gracefully falls back to a zero-data offline search whenever API keys
are absent.
When running in hosted mode the same command exposes an OpenAI Agents tool and
an optional Google ADK endpoint for seamless integration with other agent
orchestrators.
You may also run ``python official_demo_final.py`` for the same behaviour or
``python official_demo_production.py`` to verify the environment and enable the
optional ADK gateway when available. The companion script offers identical
behaviour and is recommended when deploying the demo in production settings.

### Production Quickstart

Run the officially supported command below to launch the demo with automatic
environment checks, OpenAI Agents integration when available and graceful
fallback to offline mode:

```bash
python official_demo_final.py --episodes 5
```

### Zero‑Data Quickstart

For a guaranteed offline run with no external dependencies, run the demo
with the ``--offline`` flag. This sets ``ALPHA_AGI_OFFLINE=true`` before
delegating to the production script so the search loop never attempts
network access:

```bash
python official_demo_final.py --offline --episodes 5
```

Highlights:
- Automatic offline fallback when no API key is detected.
- The environment variable ``ALPHA_AGI_OFFLINE`` is set automatically during
  offline fallback so submodules consistently detect zero-data mode.
- Optional OpenAI Agents runtime for hosted execution.
- Built-in Google ADK gateway support via `--enable-adk`.
- Runs entirely with zero external data by default.

### Colab Notebook

For an interactive walkthrough open `colab_alpha_agi_insight_demo.ipynb` directly in Google Colab. The badge at the top of this document links to the hosted version. The notebook mirrors the command line interface and is ideal for non‑technical users exploring the demo from a browser.

For programmatic access launch the companion FastAPI server:

```bash
python api_server.py --port 8000
```
Send a POST request with a JSON payload like `{"episodes":5}` to `/insight` to
retrieve the ranked sector list.

- **Zero Data Dependency**: runs entirely offline by default. The default
  sector list ships with the package so no external resources are required.
  It covers Finance, Healthcare, Education, Manufacturing, Transportation,
  Energy, Retail, Agriculture, Defense and Real Estate.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK Integration**: seamlessly switches to hosted execution when API credentials are present.
- **Automatic ADK Support**: optional Google ADK gateway activates when available.
- **Model Context Protocol Logging**: export `MCP_ENDPOINT` to persist all prompts and replies.


```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.insight_demo --episodes 5
```

### Single Command Launcher

Run the package itself to automatically select the best interface. By default it
routes through the OpenAI Agents runtime when available and transparently
degrades to the local CLI otherwise:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0
```

Pass ``--offline`` to skip the agent runtime entirely.
Use ``--skip-verify`` to bypass the startup environment check if desired.

For a quick offline run from anywhere:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0 --offline --episodes 2
```

Run the ``run_demo.py`` helper for the same behaviour without specifying the
module path:

```bash
python run_demo.py --episodes 2
```

To expose the demo via the OpenAI Agents runtime (and optional ADK gateway), run
the ``openai_agents_bridge.py`` helper:

```bash
python openai_agents_bridge.py --episodes 5
```

### REST API

Launch a small FastAPI server that exposes the search loop via ``/insight``. The
service runs entirely offline by default and mirrors the CLI options:

```bash
python api_server.py --port 8000
```

Send a POST request with JSON payload ``{"episodes":5}`` to ``/insight`` to
retrieve the ranking as structured data.

### Streamlit Dashboard

Launch an interactive web dashboard for exploring the demo:

```bash
python insight_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard lets you tweak parameters and immediately visualise the ranked
sector scores in a browser.

### Quick Start Script

Ensure the shell helper is executable by running ``chmod +x run_insight_demo.sh`` if needed.
Execute ``./run_insight_demo.sh`` from this directory for an instant launch. The
wrapper delegates to the package entry point so the demo works with or without
OpenAI API credentials.  Alternatively invoke ``run_demo.py`` directly with
Python for the same behaviour:

```bash
python run_demo.py --episodes 5
```

To always verify dependencies before running, launch the companion
``official_demo.py`` script instead:

```bash
python official_demo.py --episodes 5
```

The helper script ``official_demo.py`` offers the same behaviour when run
directly:

The standalone ``official_demo_final.py`` wrapper combines environment
verification with automatic runtime selection. Invoke it directly or via
``official_demo_final.py`` script:

```bash
python official_demo_final.py --episodes 5
```
For a quick offline run with minimal dependencies:

```bash
python official_demo_final.py --offline --episodes 2
```
Use ``--enable-adk`` to expose the agent via the optional Google ADK gateway.
Pass ``--list-sectors`` to display the resolved sector list without running the search.
Use ``--dashboard`` to launch the interactive Streamlit dashboard instead of the CLI.
Use ``--no-banner`` or set ``ALPHA_AGI_NO_BANNER=true`` to suppress the startup banner when embedding the demo in automated scripts. The same flag also works with ``official_demo_production.py``.
``--adk-host`` and ``--adk-port`` customise the gateway bind address.
Use ``--version`` to print the installed package version and exit.
For production deployments launch ``official_demo_production.py``. This variant
verifies the environment by default and automatically selects between the hosted
runtime and the offline CLI. For a splashier startup message run
``beyond_human_foresight.py`` which displays a short banner before delegating to
the same production demo:

```bash
python beyond_human_foresight.py --offline --episodes 2
```
To force a fully offline run regardless of environment configuration, launch the
demo with the ``--offline`` flag which sets ``ALPHA_AGI_OFFLINE=true``
automatically:

```bash
python official_demo_final.py --offline --episodes 3
```
The arguments mirror ``official_demo_production.py``.
Use ``--version`` to show the installed package version and exit.

## Usage

The command line interface mirrors the options of the general MATS demo:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.insight_demo \
    --episodes 10 \
    --rewriter openai \
    --model gpt-4o \
    --log-dir logs \
    --sectors Finance,Healthcare,Energy
```

Use ``--list-sectors`` to display the resolved sector list without running the
search. This is helpful when providing custom lists via ``--sectors``.

Set the ``ALPHA_AGI_SECTORS`` environment variable to override the default
sector list without editing configuration files.  Provide a comma-separated
string or the path to a text file containing one sector per line.  The
``openai_agents_bridge`` respects the same variable when launching via the
Agents runtime so your custom sector lists work in both modes.

Export ``MCP_ENDPOINT`` to capture all prompts and replies for later audit using
the Model Context Protocol. When unset the logging step is silently skipped.

When optional dependencies such as ``openai`` or ``anthropic`` are not
installed, the program automatically falls back to a simple offline rewriter so
the demo remains functional anywhere.  Episode scores are printed to the console
and optionally written to ``scores.csv`` when ``--log-dir`` is supplied.  The
path to the log file is displayed after the run completes. When ``matplotlib``
is available a ``ranking.png`` chart summarizing the sector scores is also
generated in the log directory.

### Environment Variables

- ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` – enable OpenAI-based rewriting via ``openai_rewrite``.
- ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` – use ``anthropic_rewrite`` with Claude models.
- ``OPENAI_MODEL`` – override the OpenAI model (default ``gpt-4o``).
- ``MATS_REWRITER`` – select the rewrite strategy when unspecified.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_SECTORS`` – comma-separated sector list or path to a text file.
- ``MCP_ENDPOINT`` – optional URL for Model Context Protocol logging.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_EPISODES`` – override the number of search episodes.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_EXPLORATION`` – set the exploration constant for UCB1.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_TARGET`` – specify the target sector index.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_SEED`` – RNG seed for deterministic runs.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_OFFLINE`` – force offline mode even when OpenAI Agents is available.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_ENABLE_ADK`` – enable the ADK gateway without ``--enable-adk``.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_ADK_HOST`` – custom bind host for the ADK gateway.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_ADK_PORT`` – custom bind port for the ADK gateway.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_NO_BANNER`` – suppress the startup banner when set to ``true``.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_SKIP_VERIFY`` – skip environment checks when set to ``true``.

### Graceful Offline Mode

The demo automatically falls back to an offline search strategy whenever the
required API keys are absent or network access is restricted. Dependency checks
run automatically at launch.

## OpenAI Agents Bridge

Launch ``openai_agents_bridge.py`` to control the demo via the
`openai-agents` runtime and optionally the Google ADK A2A protocol:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.openai_agents_bridge
```

Run with ``--enable-adk`` to expose the agent via the optional Google ADK gateway when available. Custom host and
port may be specified via ``--adk-host`` and ``--adk-port``. The following example launches the runtime with five
episodes and stores episode metrics in ``scores.csv``:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.openai_agents_bridge \
    --enable-adk --adk-host 0.0.0.0 --adk-port 9000 --episodes 5 --log-dir logs
```
The bridge automatically falls back to offline mode when the optional
packages or API keys are missing. Use ``--enable-adk`` to expose the agent via
the optional Google ADK gateway when available. Use ``--list-sectors`` to view
the resolved sector list without running the search. Pass ``--log-dir`` to store
episode metrics in ``scores.csv``. Use ``--no-banner`` or set ``ALPHA_AGI_NO_BANNER=true``
to suppress the startup message in automated scripts. Additional ``--exploration``
and ``--seed`` arguments mirror the offline CLI options.

### MCP Logging

Set the ``MCP_ENDPOINT`` environment variable to automatically store all
LLM prompts and replies using the
[Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).
This best-effort persistence operates transparently and never blocks the
search loop.
For additional command details, run `python official_demo_production.py --help`.
