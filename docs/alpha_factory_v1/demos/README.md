# Alpha-Factory Demo Gallery Mirror

This directory contains a static mirror of the **Alpha‑Factory** demo gallery as hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_factory_v1/demos/). Open `index.html` to explore every demo.

The mirror is generated by `scripts/generate_gallery_html.py` and bundled into the MkDocs site so non‑technical users can browse the demos directly from the repository.

- [Open a specific demo via `open_subdir_demo.py`](../../scripts/open_subdir_demo.py)
