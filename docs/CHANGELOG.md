# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- Synced `openai`, `openai-agents` and `uvicorn` pins across requirements files
  and clarified why `requests` and `rich` differ between layers.
- Documented `API_RATE_LIMIT`, `AGI_ISLAND_BACKENDS` and `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`
  environment variables.
- Added [`src/tools/analyse_backtrack.py`](../src/tools/analyse_backtrack.py) for visualising archive backtracks.
- Added CI workflow running lint, type checks, tests and Docker build with
  automated image deployment on tags and rollback on failure. Metrics are
  exported via OpenTelemetry and can be viewed in Grafana or the Streamlit
  dashboard.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-15
### Added
- CLI commands `agents-status` and `replay` for monitoring agents and replaying ledger events.
- ADK and MCP adapters bridging the Alpha Data Kernel and Multi‑Chain Proxy.
- Detailed design overview for the α‑AGI Insight demo under `alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/docs`.
- Expanded API documentation with `curl` and WebSocket examples.
- Additional CLI notes and help command reference.
- Documented `AGI_INSIGHT_MEMORY_PATH` for persistent storage configuration.
- Optional CPU and memory caps for the CodeGen sandbox via
  `SANDBOX_CPU_SEC` and `SANDBOX_MEM_MB`.
- Optional `firejail` sandboxing when the binary is available.
- Configurable secret backend for HashiCorp Vault and cloud managers via `AGI_INSIGHT_SECRET_BACKEND`.
- Protobuf dataclasses generated via `make proto` (uses the `betterproto` plugin when installed).
- Optional JSON console logging and DuckDB ledger support.
- Aggregated forecast endpoint `/insight` and OpenAPI schema exposure.
- Baseline load test metrics: p95 latency below 180 ms with 20 VUs.
- Prometheus metrics available at `/metrics`.
- Lightweight `/status` endpoint listing agent names, heartbeats and restarts.
- `GraphMemory._fallback_query` now returns stub data when both Neo4j and NetworkX are missing.
- Property-based tests verify `SafetyGuardianAgent` blocks malicious code.
- Added optional e2e test broadcasting Merkle roots to the Solana devnet.
- Example Helm values file for the Insight chart.
- `simulate` command now accepts `--energy` and `--entropy` to set initial
  sector values. The React dashboard exposes matching input fields.
- Version constant ``__version__`` defined in ``alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v1.__init__``.

## [v1.0] - 2025-07-01
- CLI commands `simulate`, `show-results`, `agents-status` and `replay` for running and inspecting forecasts.
- Web dashboard served when `RUN_MODE=web` or via `streamlit run src/interface/web_app.py`.
