## Type Checking the Demo

Run mypy only on the demo package while iterating:

```bash
mypy --config-file mypy.ini alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1
```

Replace the path with your demo directory as needed. The configuration excludes
other modules so checks remain fast.

## Running Tests

Before running the test suite, ensure optional dependencies are installed. This
project relies on packages such as `openai-agents` and `google-adk` for the
integration tests.

```bash
python scripts/check_python_deps.py
python check_env.py --auto-install  # add --wheelhouse <dir> when offline
```

The environment check installs any missing packages from PyPI (or from your
wheelhouse when offline). Once it succeeds, execute the tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Run `./codex/setup.sh` to install project dependencies. The script also
installs `pre-commit` and all lint tools before configuring the git hook.
If you skip the setup script, manually install these tools with
`pip install pre-commit -r requirements-dev.txt` and then run
`pre-commit install` once. Alternatively, execute
`tools/setup_precommit.sh` to install `pre-commit` and configure the hook
without the full environment setup.

Install the git hooks once and run them before each commit:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```
Use `pre-commit run --files docs/demos/<page>.md` to catch missing preview
images. Each page under `docs/demos/` must start with a preview image using
`![preview](...)`.

### Pre-commit in Air-Gapped Setups

When offline, build the wheelhouse first and point `pre-commit` to it:

```bash
./scripts/build_offline_wheels.sh
export WHEELHOUSE="$(pwd)/wheels"
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#pre-commit-in-air-gapped-setups) for detailed steps.
