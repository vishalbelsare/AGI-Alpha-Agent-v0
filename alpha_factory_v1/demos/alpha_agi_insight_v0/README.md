# α‑AGI Insight 👁️✨ — Beyond Human Foresight — Official Demo

The **α‑AGI Insight** demo predicts which industry sector is most likely to be
transformed by Artificial General Intelligence. It runs a small
**Meta‑Agentic Tree Search** (MATS) over a list of sector names. No external
 data is required so the script executes fully offline.  Pass a custom sector
 list with ``--sectors`` to experiment with your own domains. When the argument
 points to a text file, each non-empty line is treated as a sector name.

## Overview

- **Zero Data Dependency**: runs entirely offline by default. The default
  sector list ships with the package so no external resources are required.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK Integration**: seamlessly switches to hosted execution when API credentials are present.
- **Automatic ADK Support**: optional Google ADK gateway activates when available.
- **Model Context Protocol Logging**: export `MCP_ENDPOINT` to persist all prompts and replies.


```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.insight_demo --episodes 5
```

### Single Command Launcher

Run the package itself to automatically select the best interface. By default it
routes through the OpenAI Agents runtime when available and transparently
degrades to the local CLI otherwise:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0
```

Pass ``--offline`` to skip the agent runtime entirely.
Use ``--skip-verify`` to bypass the startup environment check if desired.

For a quick offline run from anywhere:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0 --offline --episodes 2
```

When installed as a package the ``alpha-agi-insight-demo`` command provides the
same behaviour without specifying the module path:

```bash
alpha-agi-insight-demo --episodes 2
```

To expose the demo via the OpenAI Agents runtime (and optional ADK gateway), use
the companion ``alpha-agi-insight-bridge`` command:

```bash
alpha-agi-insight-bridge --episodes 5
```

### Quick Start Script

Ensure the shell helper is executable by running ``chmod +x run_insight_demo.sh`` if needed.
Execute ``./run_insight_demo.sh`` from this directory for an instant launch. The
wrapper delegates to the package entry point so the demo works with or without
OpenAI API credentials.  Alternatively invoke ``run_demo.py`` directly with
Python for the same behaviour:

```bash
python run_demo.py --episodes 5
```

To always verify dependencies before running, launch the companion
``official_demo.py`` script instead:

```bash
python official_demo.py --episodes 5
```

When installed as a package, the `alpha-agi-insight-official` command
offers the same behaviour.

The standalone ``official_demo_final.py`` wrapper combines environment
verification with automatic runtime selection. Invoke it directly or via
the ``alpha-agi-insight-final`` command:

```bash
python official_demo_final.py --episodes 5
```
For a quick offline run with minimal dependencies:

```bash
python official_demo_final.py --offline --episodes 2
```
Use ``--enable-adk`` to expose the agent via the optional Google ADK gateway.
Pass ``--list-sectors`` to display the resolved sector list without running the search.
``--adk-host`` and ``--adk-port`` customise the gateway bind address.
Use ``--version`` to show the installed package version and exit.

## Usage

The command line interface mirrors the options of the general MATS demo:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.insight_demo \
    --episodes 10 \
    --rewriter openai \
    --model gpt-4o \
    --log-dir logs \
    --sectors Finance,Healthcare,Energy
```

Use ``--list-sectors`` to display the resolved sector list without running the
search. This is helpful when providing custom lists via ``--sectors``.

Set the ``ALPHA_AGI_SECTORS`` environment variable to override the default
sector list without editing configuration files.  Provide a comma-separated
string or the path to a text file containing one sector per line.  The
``openai_agents_bridge`` respects the same variable when launching via the
Agents runtime so your custom sector lists work in both modes.

Export ``MCP_ENDPOINT`` to capture all prompts and replies for later audit using
the Model Context Protocol. When unset the logging step is silently skipped.

When optional dependencies such as ``openai`` or ``anthropic`` are not
installed, the program automatically falls back to a simple offline rewriter so
the demo remains functional anywhere.  Episode scores are printed to the console
and optionally written to ``scores.csv`` when ``--log-dir`` is supplied.  The
path to the log file is displayed after the run completes.

### Environment Variables

- ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` – enable OpenAI-based rewriting via ``openai_rewrite``.
- ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` – use ``anthropic_rewrite`` with Claude models.
- ``OPENAI_MODEL`` – override the OpenAI model (default ``gpt-4o``).
- ``MATS_REWRITER`` – select the rewrite strategy when unspecified.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_SECTORS`` – comma-separated sector list or path to a text file.
- ``MCP_ENDPOINT`` – optional URL for Model Context Protocol logging.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_EPISODES`` – override the number of search episodes.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_EXPLORATION`` – set the exploration constant for UCB1.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_TARGET`` – specify the target sector index.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_SEED`` – RNG seed for deterministic runs.
- ``ALPHA_AGI_OFFLINE`` – force offline mode even when OpenAI Agents is available.

### Graceful Offline Mode

The demo automatically falls back to an offline search strategy whenever the
required API keys are absent or network access is restricted. Dependency checks
run automatically at launch.

## OpenAI Agents Bridge

Launch ``openai_agents_bridge.py`` to control the demo via the
`openai-agents` runtime and optionally the Google ADK A2A protocol:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.openai_agents_bridge
```

Run with ``--enable-adk`` to expose the agent via the optional Google ADK gateway when available. Custom host and
port may be specified via ``--adk-host`` and ``--adk-port``. The following example launches the runtime with five
episodes and stores episode metrics in ``scores.csv``:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v0.openai_agents_bridge \
    --enable-adk --adk-host 0.0.0.0 --adk-port 9000 --episodes 5 --log-dir logs
```
The bridge automatically falls back to offline mode when the optional
packages or API keys are missing. Use ``--enable-adk`` to expose the agent via
the optional Google ADK gateway when available. Use ``--list-sectors`` to view
the resolved sector list without running the search. Pass ``--log-dir`` to store
episode metrics in ``scores.csv``.

### MCP Logging

Set the ``MCP_ENDPOINT`` environment variable to automatically store all
LLM prompts and replies using the
[Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).
This best-effort persistence operates transparently and never blocks the
search loop.
