# Alpha‑Factory v1 👁️✨ — α‑ASI World‑Model Demo Documentation

Welcome to the documentation bundle for the **α‑ASI World‑Model demo**.
This archive contains all the user‑facing docs needed to understand, deploy, and extend the demo:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | This overview document. |
| `quickstart.md` | Step‑by‑step setup & run instructions (GUI, CLI, Docker, Helm). |
| `api_reference.md` | REST & Web‑Socket endpoints. |
| `agents_overview.md` | What each agent does & how they collaborate. |
| `safety_notes.md` | Alignment, safety, and antifragility considerations. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history. |

All files are Markdown or vector graphics, so they render nicely on GitHub and in most IDEs.

Enjoy exploring the future of **agentic AGI**! 🚀
